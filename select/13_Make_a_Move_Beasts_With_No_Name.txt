When you look in my eyes
I put on a disguise
I'm shaking, shaking so high
Careful walking on ice

Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice

I could stumble and fall
Crawling and sloth the wall
I've done it all before
And I keep on wanting you more

Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice

Say it out loud, say it out loud, say it out loud
I wanna see you

Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
Make a move, make a move
What you have to lose
I don't wanna think twice
