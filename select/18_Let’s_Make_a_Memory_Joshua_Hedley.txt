How bout a dance, do you mind a waltz
There's just something about them I love
This old song is a favorite of mine
But it's never sounded better than it does tonight

Let's make a memory we'll never forget
One that'll make you smile when it runs through your head
I believe it'll be one we won't regret
Let's make a memory

When this song ends there's an old corner table
It's empty and calling our names
Did you say you were drinking red wine
I'll bring it to you honey, do you wanna talk a while

Let's make a memory we'll never forget
One that'll make you smile when it runs through your head
I believe it'll be one we won't regret
Let's make a memory
Let's make a memory

Closing time's closing in on us

Let's make a memory we'll never forget
One that'll make you smile when it runs through your head
I believe it'll be one we won't regret
Let's make a memory
Let's make a memory
Let's make a memory
Let's make a memory
