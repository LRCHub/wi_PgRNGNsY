Yeah I got to make moves yeah
I've been with the dogs in the way we been trying to run it up
I can not lose no
I've been in the lab all night till the sun is up
With a pen and a pad
I know they're mad
Going out bad yeah
I'm trying to stack all of the cash into the dash yeah
Could do this shit with me eyes closed while I'm walking a tightrope
You know I stay on my grind cause these dollar signs on my mind oh
I'm trying to live my life
They're trying to block my shine oh
I don't pay them no mind
but I make them pay for my time oh yeah
Aye, I'm making moves in silence
You know where you can find me
In the studio every night oh yeah
I'm trying to take off to the islands with my crew behind me like a pilot
Cause we're on our way to the top and

Oh, oh-oh

We're making moves (yeah)
Heading on up and I'm loving the view
Stack all the blues (stack it up)
I like my women when they come in twos
Let's go (Let's go) yeah
Driving around on the road
Count up the dough
Count bank rolls so much that it's spilled on the floor
I can't even count no more
Wooh
I put my foot in the five
I blow that smoke in the sky
Fuck up a check but don't fuck up a vibe
Fame or the money? I couldn't decide
That's why I kill the beat, it's a crime
I turn a five to a dime
You thought you're a slime
You're just a slug on a slide
That why you're not on this side
Oof, yeah
They already know the plan
They already know it's them
Running it up
Look at them do it again
True to blue and the band
Fucking it up
Ain't no one new in the fam
We've got enough
Swear that they thought it was luck
Remember they counted me out and now we're counting up

Look at my eyes
What do you do?
Follow my whip
Come with the crew
They want to fight
We do not lose
Up on the rise

Oh I got to make moves
Oh, oh-oh

You were only doing right
In the end I will be fine
Darkness can escape the light
Keep looking forward
Never look behind
Know one day I will suffice
Now I'm going to catch the sign
Keep searching
I can't lose myself
Listen me
Emerge in work you ain't could tell
Life's trip's an excursion
I am doing well
And it's patience
I'm not urging and I'm dodging hell
Dodging hell
