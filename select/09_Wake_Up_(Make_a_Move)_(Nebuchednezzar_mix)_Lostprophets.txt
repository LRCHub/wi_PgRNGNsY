So are we lost or do we know
Which direction we should go
Sit around and wait for someone to take our hands and lead the way
Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers
Our answers
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting for us to
Wake up, wake up wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting
For us to make a move
Are we meant to take the bait
Should we sit around and wait
Are we being saved, or was that another lie you made to make us hate
Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers
Our answers
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting for us to
Wake up, wake up wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting
For us to make a move
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's time to make a move
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's time to make a move
It's not enough
To let it work
Where's the truth
It's all wrong
We're sick of waiting for our answers
Our answers
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting
Waiting for us to
Wake up, wake up wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting
For us to make a move
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's time to make a move
Wake up, wake up, wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Make a move
